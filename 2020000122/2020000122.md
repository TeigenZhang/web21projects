### Laws and Clauses Reference Extraction from Social Media

#### Task design

This task focuses on the problem of **extracting laws and clauses mentioned in the web text**. The main task is to match the web text with the corresponding laws and clauses. 

Due to the irregular expression such as omitting, skipping, and retelling, it is difficult to obtain laws and clauses directly from the text. For this difficulty, I proposed ``DS-LSTM``, a hybrid hierarchical extraction model based on ``DFA``, feature word sequence and deep text matching model, this article converts the extraction of laws and clauses into text retrieval problems, and based on the Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA), I preliminarily filtered out the set of laws and clauses corresponding to the text. Then I selected the feature words to represent the clauses according to the TF-IDF. The match of the feature words can distinguish different history versions of the law. By calculating the similarity between the feature word sequences of the text and the clause, candidate clauses can be given, and then the text and the candidate clauses can be put into the ``MV-LSTM`` to obtain the semantic similarity. I used the semantic similarity to match the text and the clause.
